# Nim Misère

The Nim game is a simple game in which two players take turns drawing pieces from a pile or a row (in this case). In classic Nim, the player who drew the last piece wins. In the Misère variant, however, he loses.

The player can choose whether he wants to play against a simple computer opponent or a profit-oriented computer opponent in the implemented variant.
